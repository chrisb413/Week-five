-Webmapping using leaflet allows for more control and customization however it is more challenging to learn/start.  Storymapjs is very simple to use and is a cool website too.

-Actually had fun looking up stuff about Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark and getting all the pictures for it.

-Tried seeing if i could change the map background to a custom map but it required a url to the image instead of a simple png download. Not sure why they couldnt do the same thing they did to the slideshow pics.



# Reflection Questions: #
In your journal.md for this week, think about what you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various sites and projects you explored this week. 
Tie what you find/observe to your own work. With regard to your own work, reflect on your design choices and the story you’re trying to tell, or the interesting thing you’ve found. 
Critically evaluate the thing(s) you’ve made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. 
Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?
What had an impact on you and how you think of your own historian’s craft?

- Because I only focused on mapping I can only speak about Storymapjs.  Honestly it was pretty cool.  It reminded me of Prezi's moving slideshow thing, however the artistic style of Storymapjs is more appealing to me.

- I created a map based off of the Raiders of the Lost Ark movie.  I started by looking up the synopsis of the film to tell me where Indy went.  Then i found pictures from each of the geographical locations and put text next to it.  The preview looks similar to the original from the film however Indy travels westward from the USA when visiting Nepal.

- Parents thought it was cool.

- For them it reminded them of the actual map shown in the film.  As Indy traveled around the world we, the audience, saw him travel on the map.

- Seeing the distance between scene locations was cool.  Most films just have a fade to black and suddenly appear in a new city/country.  With Jones, we follow him around the world, literally. Each time he traveled the audience watched him travel on the map.  I feel that showing the journy, even if its via a 2d map helps the viewer feel more connected and inside the film as opposed to just watching it.
