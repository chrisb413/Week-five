# Notes, I guess. #
Not much to say here.  The site was super cool and straightforward.  It is like the Wix of map-making.  Just create slides and insert text/images.

I learnt that inorder to have a custom map (which i would have liked for other map ideas) you need to have upload it via a http link.  This is different from the slideshow pictures which were simple drag&drop/import fields.


*Feel bad leaving this so blank but im running out of time in the course so i cant really do all of the assignments in full detail.  **
